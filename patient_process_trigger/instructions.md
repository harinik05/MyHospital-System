n the AWS AppSync console, go to the "Resolvers" section.
Click "Create Resolver."
Choose your Lambda data source.
For "Data source name," select your Lambda function.
For "Request mapping template," paste the request mapping template provided above.
For "Response mapping template," paste the response mapping template provided above.
Click "Create."



steps to create resolvers and connect them to your schema:

Create Resolvers:

In the AWS AppSync console, go to the "Resolvers" section.
You'll see a list of your data sources (in this case, your Lambda function). For each query and mutation in your GraphQL schema, you'll create a resolver.
Click "Create Resolver" to create a new resolver.
Choose the data source, which should be your Lambda function.
Define the request and response mapping templates as needed. These templates specify how the input data is transformed before being sent to your Lambda function and how the Lambda function's response is transformed into GraphQL response format.
For simple passthrough operations, you might not need complex mapping templates.
If you need to transform the data, you can use VTL (Velocity Template Language) in the mapping templates.
Save the resolver.
Connect Resolvers to Schema:

In the AWS AppSync console, go to the "Schema" section.
You'll see your GraphQL schema defined there.
For each query and mutation in your schema, select it. You'll see options for connecting a resolver.
Click on the "Attach" button or similar action, which will allow you to connect the resolver you created earlier to the query or mutation.
Choose the resolver you created for that specific operation.
Save or update your schema.


-----
To use AWS AppSync with Lambda resolvers, you need to define a GraphQL schema and connect it to your Lambda function. In your case, you want to use the code you provided as a Lambda function in AWS AppSync. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. **Create an AWS AppSync API**:

   - Go to the AWS AppSync console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/).
   - Click "Create API."
   - Choose "Build from scratch."
   - Enter an API name and an optional description.
   - Click "Create."

2. **Define Your GraphQL Schema**:

   - In the AppSync console, go to the "Schema" section.
   - Click "Attach" to create a new schema.
   - Define your GraphQL schema in this section. This should be the schema you provided earlier.

3. **Create a Lambda Function**:

   - Go to the AWS Lambda console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
   - Click "Create function."
   - Choose "Author from scratch."
   - Enter a function name and choose Node.js 14.x as the runtime.
   - In the function code section, paste your code that you provided earlier.

   Note: Make sure your Lambda function has the appropriate IAM permissions to access AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, Cognito, etc.

4. **Create Data Sources**:

   - In the AppSync console, go to the "Data Sources" section.
   - Click "Create data source."
   - Choose "AWS Lambda function" as the data source type.
   - Select the Lambda function you created earlier.

5. **Create Resolvers**:

   - In the AppSync console, go to the "Resolvers" section.
   - For each query and mutation in your GraphQL schema, create a resolver that connects it to the Lambda function you created.
   - Define the request and response mapping templates as needed.

6. **Connect Resolvers to Schema**:

   - In the "Schema" section, select each query and mutation and connect them to the corresponding resolvers you created in the previous step.

7. **Deploy Your API**:

   - In the AppSync console, go to the "API URL" section.
   - Click "Create API URL" and choose "API key" or another authentication method as needed.
   - Deploy your API.

Now, your AWS AppSync API should be connected to your Lambda function, and you can use the defined GraphQL queries and mutations to invoke your Lambda function.

Remember to adjust your code to work with the event data that AppSync passes to the Lambda function. AppSync sends the GraphQL request as an event object to your Lambda function, and you'll need to parse this event to handle the GraphQL operation.

Make sure to secure your API appropriately using authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by AWS AppSync to control who can access your GraphQL API and execute operations.



------------------------------
API Gateway and AWS AppSync are both services offered by AWS for building and managing APIs, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases. API Gateway is typically used for building RESTful APIs, while AWS AppSync is designed specifically for building GraphQL APIs. 

If you want to integrate these two services, you would need to consider your use case and requirements carefully. Below are some common scenarios:

1. **Using Both Services in a Single Application**:

   - You can use AWS AppSync for your GraphQL API if you need the flexibility and real-time capabilities it offers.
   - You can also use API Gateway to manage your RESTful API endpoints for specific use cases within the same application.

   In this scenario, you would have two separate APIs, each managed by its respective service, within your AWS infrastructure. This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of both services where they are most suited.

2. **Using API Gateway as a Proxy**:

   - You can use API Gateway as a proxy to route requests to different services, including AWS AppSync.

   In this setup, API Gateway can act as a single entry point for your API traffic. You would configure API Gateway to route specific requests to the AWS AppSync service.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might integrate API Gateway with AWS AppSync as a proxy:

1. **Create Your AWS AppSync API**:

   Create your GraphQL API using AWS AppSync. Define your schema, data sources, and resolvers as needed.

2. **Create an API Gateway API**:

   Create an API in API Gateway. This API will act as a proxy to your AWS AppSync API.

3. **Set Up Proxy Integration**:

   For each resource or method in your API Gateway API that you want to proxy to AWS AppSync, configure a Lambda function integration. This Lambda function should invoke the AWS AppSync service using the AWS SDK.

4. **Define the Routing Logic**:

   In your Lambda function, implement the logic to route incoming requests to the appropriate AWS AppSync operation (e.g., Query, Mutation). This typically involves forwarding the request body and headers to the AWS AppSync endpoint.

5. **Configure Security and Authorization**:

   Ensure that you configure the appropriate security and authorization settings for both your API Gateway and AWS AppSync APIs. This might include setting up API Gateway authorizers and AWS AppSync resolvers.

6. **Test and Deploy**:

   Test your API Gateway proxy configuration to ensure that requests are correctly routed to AWS AppSync. Once you're satisfied with the setup, deploy your API Gateway API.

7. **Use API Gateway Endpoint**:

   Clients of your API will now use the API Gateway endpoint to interact with your AWS AppSync GraphQL API.

Please note that this approach adds complexity to your architecture, and it's essential to consider whether it aligns with your specific use case and requirements. In many cases, using AWS AppSync directly without an API Gateway proxy might be more straightforward and sufficient.

#MOST IMPORTANT
To route requests from API Gateway to AWS AppSync and then to a Lambda function, you typically use AWS AppSync resolvers to connect the GraphQL API to Lambda functions. You won't be able to directly code this routing logic inside a single Lambda function. Instead, you configure your AWS AppSync API to use Lambda data sources and resolvers.

Here's a high-level overview of how to set up this routing:

1. **Create a Lambda Function**: Write your Lambda function(s) that will perform the business logic when specific GraphQL operations are invoked. You might have separate Lambda functions for different GraphQL mutations or queries.

2. **Create an AWS AppSync API**:
   - In the AWS AppSync console, create a new API.
   - Define your GraphQL schema that matches your data and operations.

3. **Create AWS AppSync Data Sources**:
   - For each Lambda function, create a corresponding AWS AppSync data source of type AWS Lambda.
   - Link each data source to the respective Lambda function.

4. **Create Resolvers**:
   - For each GraphQL operation (query or mutation), create a resolver.
   - Specify the data source (Lambda function) associated with each resolver.
   - Map the GraphQL operation to the Lambda function using the resolver mapping templates.

5. **Attach the Schema to Your AppSync API**:
   - Once you've created your resolvers, attach the schema to your AWS AppSync API.

6. **Deploy Your AppSync API**:
   - Deploy the AWS AppSync API to make it accessible via a unique URL.

7. **Set Up API Gateway**:
   - In API Gateway, create a new REST API if you haven't already.
   - Create resource paths and methods (GET, POST, etc.) to receive incoming HTTP requests.
   - For each resource method that you want to route to AWS AppSync, set up integration with AWS AppSync:
     - Integration type should be "AWS_PROXY."
     - Choose the AppSync API as the integration endpoint.
     - Map the HTTP method and resource path to the corresponding AWS AppSync query or mutation.

8. **Deploy the API Gateway**:
   - Deploy the API Gateway to make it accessible via a public URL.

9. **Invoke the API**:
   - Send HTTP requests to the API Gateway endpoints.
   - API Gateway will route requests to the appropriate AWS AppSync query or mutation.
   - AWS AppSync will, in turn, trigger the associated Lambda function.

By following this approach, you can route requests from API Gateway to AWS AppSync and then to Lambda functions, allowing you to leverage the power of GraphQL for your API while still using serverless Lambda functions to implement your business logic. Each GraphQL operation (query or mutation) should have a corresponding resolver that specifies which Lambda function to invoke.
